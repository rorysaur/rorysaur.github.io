    <p class="about-text">
      I'm a web developer in the San Francisco Bay Area.
    </p>
  
    <p class="about-text">
      I got my humble beginnings taking edX courses in Python and C as something to do in my free time while I was an SAT tutor. Now I build cool stuff in <strong>Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Backbone, HTML, CSS, and Node.js</strong>.
    </p>
  
    <p class="about-text">
      Quality, elegance, and the user experience are everything to me. I care about how intuitive it is to navigate my apps. I want my users to forget that they're looking at an app or a website.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      I believe in testing. I like debugging. I believe in code that is clean, expressive, well-designed, and easy for other people to read.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      If this sounds like the kind of developer you might want to work with, we should talk.
