      I'm a web developer in the San Francisco Bay Area.
    </p>
  
    <p class="about-text">
      I got my humble beginnings taking edX courses in Python and C as something
      to do in my free time while I was a high school tutor. Then I graduated from
      App Academy, where I learned <strong>Ruby, Rails, Postgres, JavaScript,
      Backbone, HTML, and CSS</strong>. Though I will probably always consider
      Ruby my first language, I currently work primarily with <strong>Node.js,
      Mongo, Redis, and Backbone</strong>, and have dabbled with Ember.js, Famo.us, Mocha, Objective-C/iOS, and Elasticsearch.
    </p>
  
    <p class="about-text">
      I love getting confident all the way up and down the stack, from the database to the UX, as well as in Git and deployment, so that I can jump into any problem that needs to be solved.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      I believe in testing, but haven't had the chance to do enough of it so far. I enjoy debugging. I believe in code that is clean, expressive, and easy for other people to read. Also, I swear by vim.
    </p>

      If this sounds like the kind of developer you might want to work with, we should talk.

        <strong><a href="http://silverprint.me">silverprint</a></strong>, inspired by Instagram, is an app I built using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, 
        jQuery, Backbone, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS. Users can upload, crop, sort, and share their photos, follow other users, and keep track of their favorite photos.
