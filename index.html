    <p class="about-text">
      I'm a web developer in the San Francisco Bay Area.
    </p>
  
    <p class="about-text">
      I got my humble beginnings taking edX courses in Python and C as something to do in my free time while I was an SAT tutor. Now I build cool stuff in <strong>Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Backbone, HTML, and CSS</strong>.
    </p>
  
    <p class="about-text">
      Quality, elegance, and the user experience are everything to me. I care about how intuitive it is to navigate my apps, how many clicks it takes to get from one view to another, and whether the interface is polished enough to feel like a native app. I want my users to forget that they're looking at an app or a website.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      I believe in testing. I like debugging. I believe in code that is clean, expressive, well-designed, and easy for other people to read.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      If this sounds like the kind of developer you might want to work with, we should talk.

    <p class="about-text">
      <strong><a href="http://silverprint.me">silverprint</a></strong>, inspired by Instagram, is an app I made to demonstrate my skills 
      in web development. I built it using Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, 
      jQuery, Backbone, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS.
